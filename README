Implementation of well known trick-taking card game Preference.
To compile it you need to install cmake, gtkmm, boost and librsvg.
After installing those packages run "cmake . && make". Then you can run ./runPref.sh and enjoy playing :).
You also may run "make install" to install the game. 
Any suggestions and bugs are welcomed! So don't hesitate to report them on my email.

Happy playing!
